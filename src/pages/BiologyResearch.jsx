            In 2025, I competed with the Yale iGEM Team, which earned Yale's first gold medal at the International Genetically Engineered Machine (iGEM) competition since the university's debut in 2011.

          <p style={{ marginBottom: "1rem" }}>
            The iGEM Jamboree is the world's leading undergraduate synthetic biology competition, bringing together over 400 teams from 45 countries to tackle global challenges in sustainability, healthcare, and food security. Our team, mentored by Dr. Maria Moreno and the Farren Isaacs Lab, presented a novel pipeline for systematic protein functionalization through targeted non-standard amino acid incorporation.
          </p>
          <p style={{ marginBottom: "1rem" }}>
            We demonstrated this pipeline through the case study of L-asparaginase, a chemotherapeutic enzyme limited by short half-life and immunogenicity. By site-specifically incorporating non-standard amino acids as chemical "hooks," we explored ways to extend its half-life using palmitic acid conjugation. Alongside the wet lab work, I helped develop a machine learning model integrating molecular dynamics simulations and experimental results to predict promising edit sites and identify structural patterns in protein engineering.

          <p style={{ marginBottom: "1rem" }}>
            Beyond the bench, I also contributed to our team's human practices and outreach initiatives:

            <strong>How Does One Make a Carrot as Nutritious as a Blueberry?</strong><br />
              In order to create more
              bioavailable commercial carrots, scientists want to remove the acylation chemical modification
              characteristic on anthocyanin, a nutrient found in berry-colored fruits and vegetables. The
              attachment of this acyl group makes anthocyanin more stable and structured within plants;
              however, it also makes it difficult for humans to break down anthocyanin for its multiple health
              benefits like increased cardiac health and better sugar metabolism. Previous research suggests
              that the DcSCPL1 gene plays a crucial role in acylating carrot anthocyanin. Thus, our goal is to
              induce early termination in a conserved region in DcSCPL1 through a gRNA-mediated deletion.

            <strong>Does Gas Station Soil Contain Plastic-Degrading Bacteria?</strong><br />
            With the rise of climate change and pollution, there is a growing need to find sustainable ways to remove contaminants and restore ecological balance. My project explored the potential of bioremediation, a process that uses natural organisms such as microbes and plants to detoxify the environment.
            According to ScienceDirect, bioremediation technologies have the potential to clear ecosystems of both man-made and natural contaminants, improving public and environmental health. Beyond plastic degradation, this approach could provide cost-effective and sustainable solutions for treating hazardous waste, restoring soil quality, and even cleaning oil spills or wastewater through microbial or enzymatic activity.
            The goal of my research was to isolate and culture oil-degrading and potentially plastic-degrading bacteria from a soil sample collected at a local gas station. By identifying and characterizing these bacteria, this work contributes to a broader vision of using biology to address some of the planet’s most pressing environmental challenges.

            During early brain development, neurons must extend axons that navigate complex environments to find their correct targets. My research explored the potential interaction between plasticity-related genes (PRGs), known for their role in memory and learning, and lysophosphatidic acids (LPAs), lipid molecules integral to synaptic signaling and neuropathic pain.
          </p>
          <p style={{ color: "#ddd", lineHeight: "1.6", fontSize: "1.05rem", marginBottom: "1rem", textAlign: "left" }}>
            Previous studies suggest that PRG2 may regulate LPA receptor activity by inhibiting its responsiveness. To test this, I performed a neurite retraction assay using rat neuroblastoma (B103) cells, comparing wild-type and PRG2-overexpressing cells, both with and without LPA receptors (B103-LPA2 and B103-LPA4). Cells were treated with varying LPA concentrations, and changes in rounding behavior were analyzed. Complementary RT-PCR results confirmed that PRG2 was already expressed in the base cell line, indicating that our experiment examined overexpression effects rather than simple presence or absence.
          </p>
          <p style={{ color: "#ddd", lineHeight: "1.6", fontSize: "1.05rem", marginBottom: "1rem", textAlign: "left" }}>
            While literature suggests PRG2 should suppress the LPA-induced RhoA/ROCK signaling pathway and reduce neurite retraction, our preliminary findings showed that PRG2-overexpressing cells were just as likely to round in response to LPA treatment. These results point toward a more complex relationship between PRG2 and LPA signaling than previously assumed.

              This analytics report explores global happiness survey data over multiple years to identify key socioeconomic factors driving well-being. Using regression modeling and correlation analysis, it highlights that social support, healthy life expectancy, perceptions of corruption, and emotional well-being are the strongest predictors of life satisfaction, while factors like generosity show little impact. The study also reveals regional differences, emphasizing how location and living conditions shape happiness. Visualizations were created using R packages like ggplot2.

              In 2020, the COVID-19 pandemic irreversibly changed global health, economies, and daily life. Four years later, shifts from
              rapid response to immediate outbreaks to dealing with the virus's long-term effects led to new important questions: Will
              COVID-19 infection rates settle down over time, and what factors will influence their long-term behavior? Additionally,
              can we use sporadic updates to predict daily new cases in order to more accurately track the progression of cumulative
              cases of COVID through a population? Answering these questions is crucial for future public health strategies and the
              ever growing impact of airborne infections. This project uses linear algebra methods, specifically Markov chains with
              steady-state analysis and least-square approximation, to study and predict how COVID-19 infection rates might change
              over given time periods. Markov chains model the chances of moving between different stages of infection, allowing us to
              find steady states of infection rates and make important assumptions. Additionally, these matrices allow for individualized
              probability predictions after a certain time frame (transitions). On the other hand, least-square approximation provides a
              way to determine COVID-19 cases more accurately in broader data sets, which is useful when COVID-19 data is tracked
              at larger time intervals. By combining these mathematical tools, this study aims to determine the future of COVID-19
              in our population.
